Providing a User Interface- While we currently only see GUI (Graphical User Interface) in our Operating Systems there is the original which was a Command-Line Interface. These allow us to interact with our applications and devices. The GUI made this way simpler to use as it associates files and systems with intuitive structure and graphics. You typically only see Command-line Interface in server settings but they allow a user more control to manage detailed settings.
Managing Programs- Most Operating Systems today use a multitasking system. This allows us to run multiple applications or processes at once. So, for example, you can write code in Notepad++ while listening to a podcast on Youtube. A way to view all the tasks you have open is Task Manager.
