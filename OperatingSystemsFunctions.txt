Providing a User Interface- While we currently only see GUI (Graphical User Interface) in our Operating Systems there is the original which was a Command-Line Interface. These allow us to interact with our applications and devices. The GUI made this way simpler to use as it associates files and systems with intuitive structure and graphics. You typically only see Command-line Interface in server settings but they allow a user more control to manage detailed settings.
Managing Programs- Most Operating Systems today use a multitasking system. This allows us to run multiple applications or processes at once. So, for example, you can write code in Notepad++ while listening to a podcast on Youtube. A way to view all the tasks you have open is Task Manager.
Configuring Devices- Each device you plug into the computer needs a driver to work. Most Operating Systems will find these drivers for you so you do not need to manually install them. This is called "Plug and Play". If yours does not have Plug and Play then you can download the drivers from the Internet or with the CD that came with your device.
